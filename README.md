This is the web application designed using html,css and boostrap this is completely based on mobile view so we need to keep our viewport to the 450px or less.

index1 is the 1st page with logo.
index2 is the 2nd page to select login or without login.
index3 is the 3rd page to choose whether to continue login with number or email.
index4 is the 4th page to login in the sysytem.
At first index1 is the page with logo only, we will get redirected to index2 and futher more by clicking on the main logo then the simple paradigm followed to go on the different pages.
